              Romulus and his twin brother Remus were the sons of the God
              Mars.When they were very young they were abandoned by the banks of
              the River Tiber and left to fend for themselves.Luckily for them
              they were found by a she-wolf who took pity on them fed them with
              her milk. The boys were later found by a shepherd who raised them.
              The boys grew up to be very strong and clever and they decided to
              build a town on the spot where the Shepherd had found them. They
              named their town Rome.The Romans called London 'Londinium'.The
              language we used today was developed from the Romans. The Romans
              spoke and wrote in Latin and many of our words are based on Latin
              words.the roman shields were called scutums.the swords were called
              the gladius.the armour was called lorica segmentata.
