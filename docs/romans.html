              Romulus and his twin brother Remus were the sons of the God Mars.
              When they were very young they were abandoned by the banks of the
              River Tiber and left to fend for themselves. Luckily for them they
              were found by a she-wolf who took pity on them fed them with her
              milk. The boys were later found by a shepherd who raised them. The
              boys grew up to be very strong and clever and they decided to
              build a town on the spot where the Shepherd had found them. They
              named their town Rome.
